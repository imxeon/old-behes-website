<h3 class="description">
1: The adjudicator flips the coin to decide the proposition
    and opposition team before announcing the motion.

2: The adjudicator will announce the motion and give 15 minutes
    to both the teams to prepare their arguments. Participants 
    are allowed to use any kind of device (mobiles, laptops etc.),
    the internet or reading material
    in any form during this preparation time.

3: After 15 minutes, the first speaker from the proposition team 
    (for the motion) will come forward and present his/her arguments.
    S/he can speak for 3-4 minutes. The adjudicator will tap once
    when 3 minutes are over and twice after 4 minutes.
    Any arguments presented beyond this time won't be considered,
    however the speaker can complete his/her sentence after the tap.

4: After a gap of 60 seconds the first speaker from the opposition
    team will come forward and speak.

5: In this way, speakers from each team will speak alternately with
    a gap of 1 minute between each speaker.

6: The adjudicator will announce the winner at the end of the debate
    after all the speakers have spoken, and the scores have been tabulated.
