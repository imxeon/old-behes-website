Behes is an organization aiming to promote effective communication,
public speaking and debate in India and beyond through language labs,
workshops and tournaments.A community of debaters that continues to
grow is our pride and joy, and all you need to do to join the community
is attend an event near you!



You will find, as you progress through a season, that the difficulty
scales up leading to the Season Finals,as debaters get well versed 
in the format and interpretation of the reading material provided.    



In the 'Behes' format, you don't just prepare your debate at home 
and go to the podium to read it for 5 or 10 minutes in front of 
an audience and judges. It has a different procedure.There is
reading material provided on which the motions at a tournament are based,
and this reading material can be viewed from the 'How to Prepare' section.
All the debates are impromptu, with a maximum preparation time of 
fifteen minutes allotted to the teams.



'Behes' debates follow a format that helps hone your Reading, Research,
Analytical and Persuasive skills apart from oratory abilities.
 

Get in touch with any of the debaters from our community to know more!
