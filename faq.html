<div class="ourteamalign1"><div class="rsz_mike"><img src="images/rsz_mike (1).jpg"></div><h2 class="headings">What is the format?</h2></div>
<h3 class="description">
'Behes' follows a free-flowing format in which three speakers make up a team and every speaker gets

a maximum of four minutes to speak. There are no interjections, points of information or rebuttals

allowed outside the allocated four minutes. The preparation time allowed before every debate is 15

minutes. The debaters are allowed to access the internet or refer to any other sources in this time.

Every Behes round is held in a knock-out format, with a certain number of top teams at every

tournament qualifying for the season finals (Maha Behes) , which are held every June!

<div class="ourteamalign1"><div class="rsz_mike"><img src="images/rsz_mike (1).jpg"></div><h2 class="headings">How old do I have to be to participate?</h2></div>
<h3 class="description">
 There are two age divisions ; Cubs (9-13 years) and Lions (14 years and above). The two age divisions

compete separately at each event, including the season finals. Participants must carry their school ID to

confirm their ages. Please note that the participant's ages on tournament day will be taken into account

to determine their divisions.

<div class="ourteamalign1"><div class="rsz_mike"><img src="images/rsz_mike (1).jpg"></div><h2 class="headings">Can I participate if my school isn't?</h2></div>
<h3 class="description"> Yes, we allow teams to register as individual delegations as well. Non- school delegations are fairly

common at Behes events, and we also allow mixed or cross-school teams to participate. Just pick a team

name and register for an event near you!

<h3 class="description">
 Behes debates are unique in that all the motions are derived out of an eclectic reading (and viewing

list that is refreshed every few months. The themes covered in this list will be the basis for the motions

unveiled at our tournaments. Read, watch, think and research.

<div class="ourteamalign1"><div class="rsz_mike"><img src="images/rsz_mike (1).jpg"></div><h2 class="headings">What is the 'Maha Behes'?</h2></div>
<h3 class="description">The Maha Behes is our labour of love to the community-held around June every year. It is a

platform for the top teams from every round to face off against each other and to crown one final

Champion Team at the end of the season. The Maha Behes is larger in scale than most other Behes

events-and it closes every year with the Maha Behes Ball, an evening of fun, DJ's and dancing!
